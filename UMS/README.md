    <p><strong>ManAge:</strong> A user management system (UMS) is essential for efficiently managing user accounts and access within an organization. It centralizes the oversight of user identities, roles, and permissions, allowing administrators to ensure users access resources appropriately, thus enhancing security and efficiency. By streamlining user-related processes, ManAge improves control over user activities and ensures compliance with security policies. This system securely manages user information, reduces administrative workload, and significantly enhances the user experience.</p>
